You sent me the correct code. Now disconnect and reprogram your software to show all messages in green color. If you don't know how check the documentation for excercise 2.5.1. Then reconnect and send me the code 753421.

You sent me the correct code. Now send me the result of the following. Compute the sum of first 5 digits of your student ID, then divide it by the fifth digit and send me the remainder of the division. WARNING - If the fifth digit is zero, use 9 instead. The result must be computed by your software! 

USER   -> "1" was send...

You sent the correct remainder, now reprogram your software so that your messages will be displayed on the left side of the screen and mine on the right side of the screen If you need advice check the documentation for excercise 2.5.2. MAKE SURE OF THIS - your messages must end before the half of the screen, mine start after it. No word can be divided across lines. After finishing reconnect and send me this code 333222111.

You sent the correct code. In the next message send me the code 123; then I'll send you a cipher of length 132 created by XOR 55. Decipher it and follow the orders! If you need advice check the documentation for excercise 2.3.2.

Yes, Trinity was in the Eiffel Tower, but agent Smith kidnapped her. Now, send me the string PRIMENUMBER. Then, you will receive a noisy message. Take every character on prime number letter positions (2,3,5...), and put these characters together to form a string and send me this string. ALERT! The string can not be hardcoded in your software, you must invent an algorithm for this to sharpen your analytical abilities in order to fight enemy agents better.

Correct. It is crucial to record all our communication and send it to Sion. Therefore, re-code your software to store all our communication to a file. It must be clear from the log who sent what. Then send me the string Trinity.
